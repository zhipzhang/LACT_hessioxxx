2024-02-27  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* hess/io_hess.c: Better formatting of message about data bug fix.

2024-02-26  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* hess/io_hess.c: Central event trigger types mask fix and
	extension.  Sim_telarray between 2023-07-07 and 2024-02-25 could place trigger
	mask modifier bits, like for random mono triggers, in the wrong
	place.  We check for that problem now and fix it where it happens.
	For that to work, we place existing data under the assumption that
	not more than four types of triggers have to be supported (currently
	implemented: three, maximum in pre-processor so far: four).  Support
	for future versions with more than four trigger types has been
	added.  Data format falls back to old format if new one is not
	needed.

2024-02-20  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* eventio_addon/io_history.c: Fix typo in doxygen tag.

2024-02-20  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* common/hconfig.c, common/hconfig.h: Add feature to iterate over
	known items.  If an application wants to do something with every configuration
	item, we should have a simple (even though not efficient) way to
	iterate over them, one item at a time.

2024-02-20  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* eventio_basic/eventio.c: Fix signed/unsigned comparison warning.

2024-02-19  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* eventio_addon/io_histogram.c, eventio_basic/eventio.c,
	eventio_basic/io_basic.h: More control over I/O buffer initial size.  In addition to hard-coded default and minimum sizes for I/O buffers,
	these can now also be controlled through environment variables
	"NEW_IO_BUFFER" and "MIN_IO_BUFFER". For histogram files there is an
	additional "HDATA_IO_BUFFER" for a more application specific initial
	size.

2024-02-19  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* hess/read_hess.c: Short-hand single and stereo options added.  Adding short hand notation options to set both the number of images
	and of triggered telescopes to be at least one or two, for
	single-telescope or stereo conditions.  Also print a simple total event statistics line at the end, as the
	'@;' run summary statistics line needs more careful reading than
	that.

2024-02-08  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* : commit a9aa60dbc6e463e0dfd1107b7cb01fd780c05363 Author: Konrad
	BernlÃ¶hr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de> Date:   Thu Feb 8

2024-02-08  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* hess/extract_simtel.c: Fix bugs and add trigger list option.  Incorrect use, like without an output file name, could result in a
	core dump. Added more checks.  Array trigger rules after extraction
	like the HESS hybrid trigger (any two telescopes, or CT5 in mono)
	are now supported as well.

2024-02-08  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* hess/camera_image.c: Fix setting of plot page title.  Make sure the '--plot-with-title' option already works on the first
	page.

2024-02-06  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* rht.cc: Add option to show the number of events.  In place of the energies with 1 percent and 1 permille of the events
	below, the '--show-num' options replaces these columns with the
	number of simulated and triggered events (as based on histograms
	6/7).

2024-02-06  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* common/histogram.c: Adding up the entries in add_histogram().  When adding a new histogram to an existing one, the number of
	entries should better be added up as well, even though this could be
	wrong.  For histograms filled with prepared content at once, that
	number of entries would just be the number of bins, and we would get
	a multiple of the number of bins. In the perhaps more typical case
	of histograms filled with entries one at a time, adding them up is
	the correct approach.

2024-02-02  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* .gitignore, Makefile, Makefile.xxx, show_prepro.cc: Include
	show_types and show_prepro in hessioxxx.  Also add a few more macros mentioned in glibc documentation to the
	show_prepro tool. Building the C-compiled variant of show_prepro now
	simply by 'make show_preproc_c'.

2024-01-28  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* hess/io_hess.c: Fix several problems with auxiliary traces.  Auxiliary traces can be used to store the internal states of the
	simulated traces. Not used in normal production. There were several
	problems found in reading back both analog and digital auxiliary
	traces, which have been fixed. Also print more information if
	something seems wrong.

2024-01-19  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* .gitignore: More files to ignore.

2024-01-19  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* rht.cc: Histograms 6&7 no longer used by default.  Histograms 6 and 7, being filled without event weights, are not
	suitable to derive the trigger rates if simulations involved
	importance sampling.  Only use them in the calculation if
	explicitely asked.

2024-01-19  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* show_prepro.cc: Floating-point related definitions added.

2023-12-19  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* hess/io_hess.c: Number of arrays = 20 may be wrong.  If the MC run header block reports that each shower is used 20
	times, this might actually be wrong if obtained from the first
	CORSIKA event header. That data block cannot hold more than 20
	offsets. Add a little hint to that limitation to the print function.

2023-12-12  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* show_prepro.cc: More architecture and compiler macros.

2023-11-10  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* corsika/io_simtel.c: Fix missing newline in print output.

2023-11-10  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* corsika/read_iact.c, eventio_basic/eventio.c,
	eventio_basic/listio.c, hess/read_hess.c: Add optional even more
	detailed info on I/O blocks

2023-11-09  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* hess/io_hess.c: Special fix for old laser calib data with >= 32768
	pixels.  There are simulation data files existing for cameras with >= 32768
	pixels which exceed the limits foreseen in the laser calibration
	data block at the time but can be recovered if the 16-bit integer
	for the number of pixels is interpreted as unsigned (up to 65535).
	The latest format can handle more pixels without problems.

2023-11-09  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* Makefile: Large code model switch Add reminder for large code model switch if we have huge cameras
	etc.

2023-11-08  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* hess/io_hess.h, hess/split_hessio.c: Transition of data block
	naming is complete.  The defined symbolic names for the data block type numbers handled
	by io_hess.c and related code have been changed from
	IO_TYPE_HESS_...  to IO_TYPE_SIMTEL_... over some time, with full
	backward compatibility.  This should conclude these changes, still
	retaining compatibility.

2023-11-07  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* Makefile.hess2hessioxxx: Makefile for directory hessioxxx export This Makefile can, just like the normal Makefile, transform the
	hessio directory structure (as used within HESS) into the structure
	used with the 'hessioxxx' exported version. Without depending on
	other Makefile components in other modules of the HESS source code
	repository.

2023-11-07  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* hess/io_hess.c: Support >= 32768 pixels in laser calibration data.  The laser calibration data block was only supporting up to 32767
	pixels in a camera. Other data blocks which started with such a
	limitation in the early days of sim_telarray were already changed to
	write a 32-bit integer where appropriate. Where there was a switch
	between versions, this switch now depends on the actual number of
	pixels in a camera and no longer on the H_MAX_PIX preprocessor
	definition.

2023-10-27  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* hess/rec_tools.c: Add comments to avoid confusion about sin/cos
	use.

2023-10-27  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* corsika/io_simtel.c: Use run number from data block header.

2023-10-20  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* hess/io_hess.h: Documentation comments only.

2023-10-20  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

2023-07-16  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	symlink back to the module library directory was broken.

2023-07-16  Konrad Bernlöhr <Konrad.Bernloehr@mpi-hd.mpg.de>

	* .gitignore: In place of .cvsignore we now need a .gitignore.

	root/cvt3.cc: Here comes a rather big set of changes: - This includes the first change to the eventio data format for more
	than a decade. It provides an optional extension field to item
	headers of which so far 12 bits have been assigned for extending the
	length field from 30 bits (1 GByte) to 42 bits (4 TByte) on 64-bit
	systems. On 32-bit systems no I/O blocks of more than 2 GByte can be
	handled. By default, all data is written in the old format, without
	extension field. Therefore, all existing software should continue to
	work as before and writing data that can be read with older eventio
	versions. Automatic insertion of the extension field, which is
	possible though extremely inefficient, is not implemented yet. To
	take advantage of the extension field, one has to set the 'extended'
	flag in the I/O buffer once or use the put_item_begin_with_flags
	function with the corresponding flag set for each item that might
	exceed the GByte barrier.  - Another (minor) change to the data format is setting aside a
	previously reserved bit in the type/version field for a
	user-controlled flag bit.  If data with this flag set is read by
	older software, the flag will simply be ignored. Again, by default,
	everything is written as it used to be.  - The testio and TestIO programs have been extended for a more
	complete coverage of the eventio functionality. Both of them can
	write and read their data in the old format as well as the extended
	format.  - The C++ interface has been extended to cover the same level of
	functionality as the C interface, without need to call the C
	functions directly.  - The remaining support for pre-ANSI-C compilers has been dropped.
